This application is specifically designed for civil engineers and aims to assist them in designing drip and pivot irrigation systems. Its primary purpose is to provide engineers with an initial understanding of the calculations involved in designing an irrigation network for a given piece of land. It also offers insights into the estimated water consumption, pipe requirements, and other relevant calculations. Additionally, the application provides approximate quantities of pipes and equipment needed for the design, along with a price estimation that closely reflects the project's cost.

note : Due to time constraints and the uncertainty of our university professors' acceptance of this new idea, it is crucial to develop this application quickly. To provide a demonstration, we are currently utilizing useState and prop drilling for state handling. However, for improved state management in the future, we plan to implement the context API. The code requires significant refactoring and structural improvements. Additionally, the user interface needs further attention, and we have utilized Material UI for its convenience within the limited timeframe, as previously mentioned.

note : This application is specifically designed for civil engineers, meaning that it is exclusively intended for their use. Unfortunately, if you are not a civil engineer, you will not be able to utilize this application.
